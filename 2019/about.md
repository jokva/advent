A language a day
================
Solutions in a new language every day. As a result, in particular in unfamiliar
languages, solutions are quite unidiomatic, as I rarely bother too much with
refactoring once the problem is solved.

The intcode problems were great fun, but it got pretty tedious to re-implement
it every time. At day 7 I caved and did it in C++, instead binding it to the
lagnuage-of-the-day when it popped up again. Day 9 was an unfortunate event as
the whole task was extending it, and the problem after that being trivial,
meaning C++ was used twice.
